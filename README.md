# PEER-REVIEW-DECISION


Here we propose a model that could help you determine the acceptance/rejection of a paper using peer reviews.

We use the CMU dataset as part of our training and evaluation
It can be downloaded directly from the link below:

After downloading the folder, you can load the dataset in our format using load_dataset.py script                                                                                                 
just specify the path of "review_with_aspect.jsonl file" in it
